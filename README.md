This project implements a **fully reproducible, automated pipeline** to analyze longitudinal structural MRI data from the **Prevent-AD dataset**. We track subtle changes in cortical thickness and subcortical volumes over 12 months in a single at-risk participant, revealing patterns consistent with early Alzheimer’s disease.

**Motivation**: Early detection of structural alterations is critical for understanding disease progression
and identifying individuals at high risk for AD, especially those with a strong family history. The
Prevent-AD dataset provides a unique longitudinal neuroimaging resource that allows researchers to
monitor subtle changes in brain anatomy across multiple timepoints in cognitively unimpaired but
at-risk participants. By investigating structural changes across sessions, researchers can better
understand preclinical AD progression and evaluate imaging biomarkers that may be predictive of
cognitive decline.

**Research Question**: How do participants’ cortical and subcortical volumes change over time in the
Prevent-AD dataset?

**Hypothesis**: We hypothesize that cortical thickness will show progressive decline over time, particularly in temporal and parietal regions, while subcortical volumes will display region-specific atrophy. These patterns reflect structural trajectories commonly observed in the preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease.
To address this research question, we applied a **structural imaging analysis pipeline** consisting of BIDS validation, quality control (QC), reconstruction preprocessing, and analysis (extraction of cortical and subcortical measures).
